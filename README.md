# Case-mobile_game_cookie_cat
This project is based on a mini project on DataCamp https://www.datacamp.com/projects/184

# Project Description
Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic "connect three" style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color in order to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats.

As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase. In this project, we will analyze the result of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will analyze the impact on player retention.

# Method
The suggested method in this A/B test is bootstrapping the differences. 
This this repo, I will try with 3 methods to evaluate the significant of difference
1. T-Test
2. Boostrap

# Conclusion
Keep the in-app purchase at gate30 since the retention rate is proven higher.
